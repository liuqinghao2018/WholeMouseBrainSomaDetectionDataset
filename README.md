# Whole Mouse Brain Soma Detection (WMBSD) Dataset 

## Data Description
--------------
&emsp; To facilitate the detection of soma, we have specially built a **Whole Mouse Brain Soma Detection  (WMBSD) dataset** which contains **798** representative image blocks extracted from several whole mouse brain images with ID 17302, 17545, and 18455. These images contain 1348 somas with total ~ 5.2x10 <sup>7</sup> voxels. Each image stack in this dataset has one or multiple neurons with a size of 256 × 256 ×256 voxels in spatial resolution of 2 × 2 × 2 μm/voxel. In the WBMSD dataset, each image contains one or more somas. All images in this dataset were manually annotated and cross-validated by three experienced experts to obtain the reference (gold standard).

## Data Sources
--------------
&emsp; The mouse whole brain images in this dataset were obtained from the Allen Brain Lab and generated by the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) imaging system. Each whole mouse brain image contains images at five different spatial resolutions: 32 × 32 × 32 μm/voxel, 16 × 16 × 16 μm/voxel, 4 × 4 × 4 μm/voxel, 2 × 2 × 2 μm/voxel, and 1 × 1 × 1 μm/voxel. Since the first three spatial resolutions (i.e., 32 × 32 × 32 μm/voxel, 16 × 16 × 16 μm/voxel, 4 × 4 × 4 μm/voxel) are too low to clearly recognize somas, the images at these resolutions are not used for soma detection. The details of the whole mouse brain images are shown in Table II. In order to reduce the computational burden while retaining sufficient spatial detail, the images at the sub-high spatial resolution were used. At this spatial resolution, the morphological structures of somas are very clear, and the amount of data is only one-eighth of the highest resolution.


## Dataset Structure

&emsp; You can get the WMBSD dataset through this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_bl_nuiPoXsPaolsxjwhzqXAJCIzOfaX?usp=sharing). The dataset is organized according to the following folder structure:  

WMBSD/  
├── images
    ├── 025480_187960_084220.tif  
    ├── 025480_248920_059520.tif

    ├── 025480_248920_059520.tif.marker
    └── ...  

&emsp;All image blocks are collected in the _images_ folder. Assuming that the coordinates of the center point of the image block in the whole brain are _(x, y, z)_, the convention for the name of each image is _x_y_z.nii.gz_ . The soma coordinate label file is placed in the _label_ folder, and the coordinate information of soma in each image block is stored in a corresponding _.tif.marker_ file, where the coordinate label of soma is relative to the coordinates of the center point of the image block .
